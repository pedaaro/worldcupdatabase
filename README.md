# World Cup Database Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a database named "worldcup" to store information related to the FIFA World Cup. The project is inspired by FreeCodeCamp.org, and I followed their instructions to design and set up the database.

## Project Structure

- The database includes two main tables: "teams" and "games."
- The "teams" table contains information about the participating teams, including a unique team_id and the team's name.
- The "games" table captures details about each game, such as the year, round, participating teams, and the final scores.
